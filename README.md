### Adversarial Search
A connect four solver (that can be broadly applied to any zero sum two player game with no hidden information). Implements various search algorithms, varying in speed and level of confidence in the solution. The user is able to play against the algorithm, or can watch the algoritihm play against itself. The bot is able to play near perfect connect four, never losing if moving first even if it's against a similar perfectly playing bot. The code could easily be adjusted to work for any two player game with perfect information, as long as it is able to be fit into a certain problem class. 
Written in python

(Note: the github is private as it is a school project).

### Mazes
A program that is able to generate random mazes and then solve them using a recursive depth first search. The program also supports writing a maze to a file and later reading it off the file, perfect for sharing mazes with other people. The program is complete with a visualizer that can visualize the maze so the user can try to solve it aswell.
Written in C

(Note: the github is private due to it being a school project).
